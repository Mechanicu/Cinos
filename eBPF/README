ATTENTION: 
1.the file *vmlinux.h* is for bpf program compiling.
It contains every type used in current kernel version.
Can use bpftool to generate it, here is cmd:
bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c

POINT:
1.hello_world:
    eBPF develop environment
    each eBPF program must include lisense
    use trace_point/tp mount point to trace syscalls

7.execsnoop(with perf buffer):
    eBPF can use perf event buf to transfer data between kernel and user space
    eBPF usually use a .map-type section to store data, each eBPF program needs
different .map-type section, decided by *TYPE*, other member may also different,
each condition has its own .map-type section
    when compile, must manully compile *.h and *.c, only compile *.c which includes 
*.h won't work
    usually, perf event needs user space program call perf_event_open() to open perf event
and decide which event to trace and for which core and process

8.execsnoop(with ring buffer)
